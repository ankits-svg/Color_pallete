Implement a React component called "ColorPalette" 
- that displays a list of colors and allows users to select a color by clicking on it.
- The component should have the following features: 

Display: The component should render a grid of color boxes, each representing a different color.
 Selection: When a user clicks on a color box, it should be visually highlighted to indicate that it is selected. 
 
 Single Selection: Only one color can be selected at a time. When a new color is clicked, the previously selected color should be unselected. 
Callback: Whenever a color is selected or unselected, a callback function should be invoked with the selected color as an argument.

 Instructions: Create a new React component called "ColorPalette" and implement the above features. Use React state to manage the selected color and update it when a new color is clicked. Make use of functional components and hooks in your implementation. Write clean and well-structured code, following best practices for React development. Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools if needed. Please provide the code for the "ColorPalette" component with the required features mentioned above.
